## 2. Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard analyzes booking, revenue, and performance metrics across multiple OYO hotel properties. It helps stakeholders monitor operational efficiency, compare properties, and optimize pricing and occupancy strategies.

## 3. Tech Stack
This project was developed using:

- Power BI Desktop – for interactive reporting and dashboard creation
- Power Query – to clean and transform data from multiple fact and dimension tables
- DAX – for key performance indicators, conditional logic, and time intelligence
- SQL – for data testing and validation
- Excel – Used for initial data exploration and preprocessing

## 4. Data Source
Source: Kaggle (OYO hotel booking dataset)
The dataset includes detailed booking records for OYO properties, with fields like booking platform, room class, occupancy, ratings, revenues, and time-based performance (weekly tracking). It integrates dimensional tables such as hotels, rooms, and dates for modeling.

## 5. Features / Highlights
